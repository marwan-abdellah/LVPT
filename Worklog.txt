10/10/2012:
- Added basic single scattering integrator using direct light sampling.
- Added a XORShift based random number generator.
- Still working on getting a correct implementation of single scattering, rendering a Cornell box with a homogeneous medium is quite challenging.

14/10/2012:
- Added emission.

17/11/2012
- Reimplemented single scattering, it is slow and the result is not yet satisfying...
- Single scattering seems to be working properly now.

22/12/2012
- Added multiple scattering.
- Added support for defining a medium as a sphere instead of an infinite one.

27/12/2012
- Experimenting with the Henyey-Greenstein's phase function.
